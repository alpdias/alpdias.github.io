# My portfolio in HTML5 and CSS3

![portfolio](https://github.com/alpdias/portfolio-html-css/blob/master/src/_img/portfolio.png)

This is my first portfolio created using only HTML5 and CSS3, it was created with the purpose of learning and showing the projects 
I'm working on. I made the idea of being a static site, which was simple and practical, I just used HTML and CSS to learn basic web 
development.
