ABOUT ME
If you wanna know who I am...

I'm Paulo, 23 years old and I'm learning to program and getting to know new technologies.
I am learning to program to become a developer, so far all I have learned has been self-taught, watching courses online, video lessons and
reading the language documentation. And as we know that the best way to learn is by practicing I created this portfolio to practice my 
knowledge, initially in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and of course all the other technologies I am learning that I can add and show here. Soon more 
I will add the projects I'm working on here.

My current knowledge in languages / technologies is:
PYTHON - SQL - HTML5 - CSS3 - JAVASCRIPT - GITHUB - NODEJS
