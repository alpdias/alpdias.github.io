ABOUT ME

If you want to know who I am ...

I'm Paulo, 23 years old, and I'm studying and learning programming.

I am studying and learning programming to become a developer, so far all I have learned was self-taught, watching online courses, video classes and reading documentation. 
And as we know that the best way to learn is by practicing, I created this portfolio and a repository on GitHub to practice my knowledge and share everything 
I am learning with programming and also with other technologies that I learn on the way and that I can share. Soon, I will add new projects here or in my repository.

My current knowledge in languages / technologies is:

PYTHON - MYSQL - DATABASE - HTML - CSS - JAVASCRIPT - GITHUB - NODEJS

PAULO PORTFOLIO

This is my first portfolio, I did it with the purpose of learning and to show the projects I'm working on. 
I created with the idea of ​​being a static, simple and practical website, just using HTML and CSS to learn web development.

INVENTORY CONTROL

This is a simple inventory control project, using JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3. I did it with the intuition of putting into practice what I am learning in the JS course 
and with that I put functions to add and remove items from a stock list, being able to remove the items in their entirety or item by item, and with verification functions 
entry and exit of information.
