ABOUT ME

If you want to know who I am ...

I'm Paulo, 23 years old, and I'm studying and learning programming.

I am studying and learning programming to become a developer, so far all I have learned was self-taught, watching online courses, video classes and reading documentation. 
And as we know that the best way to learn is by practicing, I created this portfolio and a repository on GitHub to practice my knowledge and share everything 
I am learning with programming and also with other technologies that I learn on the way and that I can share. Soon, I will add new projects here or in my repository.

My current knowledge in languages / technologies is:

PYTHON - MYSQL - DATABASE - HTML - CSS - JAVASCRIPT - GITHUB - NODEJS
